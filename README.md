- Common data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs)
- Classic algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming)
- Example problems and solutions
- Notes and explanations for revision

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

- Build a strong foundation in DSA for interviews and problem-solving.
- Practice clean coding in Go.
- Keep track of progress over time.
